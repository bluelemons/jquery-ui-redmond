# Jquery::Ui::Redmond

We use Redmond everytime and I need a gem to develop. I copied almost everything
from [rails-asset-jqueryui](https://github.com/allen13/rails-asset-jqueryui) but
I'm thinking about improve it ussing sass and compass.

## Installation (in Rails >= 3.1 )

Add this line to your application's Gemfile assets group:

    gem 'jquery-ui-redmond'

Once added you can use the redmond theme importing the css. (in application.css)

    @import redmond

## ToDo

- Add support for customization with sass variables.
- Add support for handle images with compass.
- Add a rake task to update.
